A program that takes an image and prints an ascii version of it on console.  


Example Output: 
![ascii_ataturk_photo](https://github.com/aatakansalar/oylesine_python/blob/master/ascii_img_gen_v1/example.png)


TODOs:  
1- Make it possible to save the ascii image to a file  
2- The size issue should be solved, currently you should really zoom out in the console to see the image.**
